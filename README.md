The **Investment Calculator** is a web-based tool designed to help users estimate the future value of their investments over time. It takes into account four key inputs: Initial Investment, Annual Investment, Expected Return, and Duration. The calculator then provides a detailed breakdown of the projected investment value, annual interest, total interest, and invested capital for each year.

The project is built with modern web technologies to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience, ensuring quick and accurate calculations. With a responsive design, it works flawlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.

# ðŸ’± For example, with the following inputs:

- Initial Investment: $1000
- Annual Investment: $500
- Expected Return: 5%
- Duration: 10 years

* The calculator will provide a year-by-year breakdown of your investment's growth, showing total interest earned and capital invested.
